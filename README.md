# Particle Playground

Particle Playground is a web application that allows users to create and play with particle simulations. It provides an intuitive interface for adjusting various parameters and visualizing the behavior of particles in real-time.
Based on a great tutorial from [Frankslaboratory](https://www.youtube.com/@Frankslaboratory).

## Features

- Create and customize particle systems.
- Adjust parameters such as speed, size, quantity and trails.
- Visualize particle behavior in real-time.

## Demo

You can try out Particle Playground online [here](https://cocky-wright-538283.netlify.app).

## Getting Started

### Installation

To run Particle Playground locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elnorstrom/particle-playground.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd particle-playground
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open Particle Playground in your default web browser. You can then explore the application, create and play with the particle systems.

### Deployment

To deploy Particle Playground to a live server, you can build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a production-ready build of the application in the `dist` directory. You can then deploy the contents of this directory to your preferred hosting platform.
